When I started making a mobile game, I couldn't find apprpriate materials and I didn't even know what to learn.

I think it was because there was no organized curriculum and the environment was so diverse and changing so quickly that I had to profile my game on real devices to know what is true.

I created this blog to help the programmers who begin their game development carrier by collecting and organizing information and knowledge about optimizing and troubleshooting mobile games.
